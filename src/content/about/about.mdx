I am a software developer, with a passion and curiosity for solving problems using technology.

In my previous 9 years of professional experience, I endured endless frustration working through countless technical challenges such as website updates and CRM customizations. Finally, I decided to transition into programming so I could design, build, and develop my own solutions.

I learned how to develop front-end and full-stack web applications through building my own projects and completing a 6-month intensive coding bootcamp, which I completed in January 2020.

Currently, I am looking for new full-time opportunities as a software engineer.
