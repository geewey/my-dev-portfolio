<h5>I am a software engineer, with a passion and curiosity for solving problems using technology.</h5>

In January 2020, I completed an intense 5-month software engineering course. I learned full-stack web development through building projects, some of which are listed below.

Why did I transition into programming? I wanted to design, build, and develop my own solutions to technical challenges encountered during my previous 10 years of professional experience.

<b>Currently, I am looking for full-time software engineer roles.</b>
