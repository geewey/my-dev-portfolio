<h5>I am a software engineer, with a passion and curiosity for solving problems using technology.</h5>

I build mid-tier applications for Vanguard, developing solutions in the business logic layer. I recently led a migration project for a $650MM fees platform.

Previously, I learned full-stack web development through an intense 5-month software engineering course and building projects, some of which are listed below. I want to design, build, and develop my own solutions to technical challenges encountered during my previous 10 years of professional experience.

<b>Currently, I am open to full-time software engineer roles.</b>
